# The Boneyard

Most of us are probably deeply embarrassed by the earliest programs we ever wrote. I am too, but I'm preserving them for posterity and as a testament to how far I have come.

The contents and file names in this repository are completely unchanged. The Git commit dates represent the last-modified dates as reported by the filesystem where they had been saved.

## QBasic

This was the first language I picked up (after a few forays into ASCII art and meandering menu systems written in DOS batch files). I thought these files were long lost until I found a copy stored on an 8 MB [PC Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Card) in a drawer at my parents' house.

## Websites

I first started putting things on the internet in 1998. It wasn't until 2002 or so that I started keeping local copies of that content. I presume that everything uploaded prior to 2002 is gone (I don't have a copy, and the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) doesn't either) but that is not a huge loss -- most of those pages were collections of cheat codes for PC games and "cool" animated GIFs I had found elsewhere.
