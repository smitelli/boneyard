  <p class="BodyText">Summer is running at full blast, and here's a list of crap I need (or want) to do before it's over:</p>

  <p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
      <li>Replace my processor fan.
      <li>Ditch AOL and go with DirecWay satellite broadband.
      <li>Try to get a phytsical network line down to the iMac. (WiFi is out of the question. Too many problems, platform issues, price...)
      <li>Fix 2 of Chrissy's computers.
      <li>Help Zach build his "ultimate gaming machine." (If he ever gets any money)
      <li>Install a nice 700-watt UPS on my computer. My dad pulled a nice one out of the trash; we just have to make it not so much of a fire hazard.
      <li>I need to buy some furniture for my room. I'm tired of sitting on the floor while using computers C, D, and the MIDI keyboard.
      <li>Fix the mouse port on the... um... most recent dumpster computer. It also needs either a 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>" floppy drive or a drive bay cover.
      <li>Fix Casey's monitor. I actually don't think there's anything <i>wrong</i> with it, but there must be a reason why it's in pieces in the garage.
      <li>
    </ul>
