  <p class="BodyText">I'm sure that you've all figured out that I collect computers. I am proud of the horribly obsolete "flock" that I have collected over the years. Not because they're especially fast, or because they have been blessed by the hand of the good Lord... No, it is just the simple fact that I have collected 30 (quite possibly more) computers since 1993. I have opened and upgraded them all. I hope to share some of this with you now, if you even care anymore.</p>

It was used for some mundane task at Atlantic City Medical Center (ACMC) mainland division. They threw it out, my dad got it from the trash, and it became our computer. Such humble beginnings. I'm not sure of the upgrade status of the machine before we got it, what came stock, what was added on, etc. What I am sure of, however, is what I'll tell you about it.<br><br><ul>
