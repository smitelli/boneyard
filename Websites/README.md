# Websites

## Geom-O-Rama

This was an extra credit project I did toward the end of my Geometry class in 10th grade. It was originally hosted in a subdirectory of The Undead Squirrel, at `http://www.angelfire.com/nj/undeadsquirrel/geometry`. I compiled three pages full of postulates that I must've copied from a book or somewhere, along with 12... unique... geometry word problems that I pretty obviously conceived myself.

I especially enjoyed this line in the reflective paragraph: "I really enjoyed doing this project. It was different from studying for the midterms because I actually did it."

I was a bold, subversive kid.

## Grandparents Day 2001

When I was 15 years old, I entered a contest for the annual Grandparents Day organized by Atlantic County, New Jersey. My entry was a website titled "15 Years with My Ideal Grandfather." It was essentially a photo essay in web page form, with 20 images from my life with my grandfather and a background MIDI of Clair de Lune to round things out. I believe this was hosted on Angelfire but I don't have any record of what the URL was.

I ended up winning the contest's "website" category that year (honestly I don't recall if anybody else entered).

The JavaScript count-up timer on the page ultimately reached 11,787 days when my grandfather died in 2018.

## The Undead Squirrel

Originally hosted at `http://www.angelfire.com/nj/undeadsquirrel`, The Undead Squirrel was created as a response to my good friend Matt's website, which was predictably named `deadsquirrel` and hosted under the `nj` directory. I credit Matt with showing me how Angelfire worked, and trusting me to mess around a little bit with the HTML code of his website before I decided to create one for myself.

The website in this archive is the second design of The Undead Squirrel, which was created in May/June 2002. The design aesthetic is _exactly_ Windows 95, rendering a pixel-accurate representation of an application window (I believe I used Notepad as the reference, if memory serves). It only rendered accurately in Internet Explorer 6, which was less than a year old at the time. Surprisingly it still holds itself together when viewed in browsers two decades newer.

This code represents a "pretty good" understanding of the HTML of the day, and an awareness of CSS that seems to be built on blind copy-pasting to achieve certain text styles. At its core this is very much a frames-and-tables layout. It's also clear from perusing the content that I really didn't have anything to say when I was 16 -- I was seemingly more interested in achieving a look than making content for that look to serve.

I do like the trick of omitting the opening `<body>` tag to trick Angelfire and prevent the banner ad from showing at the top of the page.

**Fun Facts:** The "Clockwork" program mentioned on the programming page was a Wolfenstein 3D-ish raycaster written in Visual Basic that I was working on at the time. On the links page, the phrase "Um... A bird? Yes!" is a reference to the song "Frontier Psychiatrist" by The Avalanches.
