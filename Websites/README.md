## The Undead Squirrel

Originally hosted at `http://www.angelfire.com/nj/undeadsquirrel`, The Undead Squirrel was created as a response to my good friend Matt's website, which was predictably named `deadsquirrel` and hosted under the `nj` directory. I credit Matt with showing me how Angelfire worked, and trusting me to mess around a little bit with the HTML code of his website before I decided to create one for myself.

The website in this archive is the second design of The Undead Squirrel, which was created in May/June 2002. The design aesthetic is _exactly_ Windows 95, rendering a pixel-accurate representation of an application window (I believe I used Notepad as the reference, if memory serves). It only rendered accurately in Internet Explorer 6, which was less than a year old at the time. Surprisingly it still holds itself together when viewed in browsers two decades newer.

This code represents a "pretty good" understanding of the HTML of the day, and an awareness of CSS that seems to be built on blind copy-pasting to achieve certain text styles. At its core this is very much a frames-and-tables layout. It's also clear from perusing the content that I really didn't have anything to say when I was 16 -- I was seemingly more interested in achieving a look than making content for that look to serve.

I do like the trick of omitting the opening `<body>` tag to trick Angelfire and prevent the banner ad from showing at the top of the page.

**Fun Facts:** The "Clockwork" program mentioned on the programming page was a Wolfenstein 3D-ish raycaster written in Visual Basic that I was working on at the time. On the links page, the phrase "Um... A bird? Yes!" is a reference to the song "Frontier Psychiatrist" by The Avalanches.
