  <p class="BodyText">Laura bought a new satellite dish, and decided that she would install it herself. The diabolical satellite company doesn't take kindly to people doing so, so they make the instructions as arcane as humanly possible.</p>

  <p class="BodyText">"The satellite is 22,050 miles above the surface of the Earth. The satellite is directly above Gamplihootz, Wyoming. You only have one chance to aim the dish. If it is off by even a fraction of a degree, the dish will explode and you will have to buy a new one."</p>

  <p class="BodyText">Laura's house is 780 miles from Gamplihootz. What is the angle of elevation the dish needs?</p>

  <p class="BodyText">Laura knows that this scenario forms a right triangle, so she can use trig on it. 22,050 is the opposite side, and 780 is the adjacent side. She sets the problem up like, tan x = <sup>22,050</sup>/<sub>780</sub>. A simple Algebra problem. The answer works out to be 87.97<sup>o</sup>. She has to point the dish up 87.97 degrees above horizontal, and that should work fine.</p>
