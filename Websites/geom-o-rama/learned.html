  <p class="BodyText">Geometry is one of the best subjects I've ever had. Geometry can be used to do so many things in our daily lives, and Geometry really links the other math classes I've taken together. I have often asked myself, "When will I ever need to use Algebra in real life?" But now, I see how it all links together. Geometry seems like it should be universal common knowledge, but it's not. That's why I'm glad I learned Geometry.
  <br><br>Imagine how it would feel to be unable to find the distance between two things, or how to find an angle that you can't directly measure. It would be a sad state, indeed. Imagine an airline pilot who didn't know about angles of elevation or depression. And would you buy a house if you weren't absolutely sure that the walls met at 90<sup>o</sup> angles? I sure wouldn't. Geometry can be used for so many things, people sometimes take it for granted.
  <br><br>I really enjoyed doing this project. It was different from studying for the midterms because I actually did it. It was a good review, going over postulates and problems that I have not seen or done in months. I think I am better prepared to take this final now that I have completed this project.</p>
