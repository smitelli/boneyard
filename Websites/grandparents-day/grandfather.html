I first met my grandfather in March of 1986. Even back<br>
then I was listening when he gave me advice. I didn't<br>
understand it, but I listened.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/2.jpg"><br>
On my first birthday, my grandfather was there to make<br>
sure I knew the difference between the cake and the<br>
candles. Everything looked good to me.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/3.jpg"><br>
When I was two, my grandfather made sure that I got a<br>
taste of the good life. It was a great time to be 2.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/4.jpg"><br>
When I turned three, my grandfather introduced me to<br>
the world of work. Something I would have to get used<br>
to from this point on.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/5.jpg"><br>
When I turned four, my grandfather must have thought<br>
that I had some sort of artistic talent. Beats me...
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/6.jpg"><br>
When I was five, my grandfather taught me how to swim.<br>
I am thankful for that. 
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/7.jpg"><br>
He also introduced me to (and somehow tolerated) my<br>
musical side.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/8.jpg"><br>
When I was six, my grandfather (who is a history buff)<br>
decided to show me the world. Our first destination was<br>
Three Mile Island. My foot <i>still</i> glows...
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/9.jpg"><br>
When I was seven, I spent the entire summer helping my<br>
grandfather paint his huge house. I was never so glad to<br>
get back to school.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/10.jpg"><br>
When I was eight, I discovered that my grandfather knew<br>
some pretty important people. I got to meet General<br>
Swartzkopf, the general in charge of the Gulf War. The<br>
admiral of the Valley Forge Military Academy is standing<br>
right behind.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/11.jpg"><br>
I also got to meet a really nice state trooper in New<br>
Hampshire when my grandfather decided to take us off-road<br>
on a ski slope. Funny, I didn't know a Grand Marquis was<br>
an off-road vehicle...
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/12.jpg"><br>
I also got to meet the mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell.<br>
His car had a lot of cool stuff.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/13.jpg"><br>
When I was nine, my grandfather tried to get me to be a<br>
star athlete. Unfortunately, I had no athletic abilities.<br>
Actually, I still don't.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/14.jpg"><br>
By the time I was 10, my grandfather and I had traveled<br>
through most of the lower 48 to make it to San Francisco.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/15.jpg"><br>
When I was 11, my grandfather finally admitted that my<br>
musical talents were pretty good. He got me a cool CD player<br>
and that lovely stuffed bear behind me.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/16.jpg"><br>
When I was 12, my grandfather went with me on the thrilling,<br>
chilling, and very scary... um... monorail.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/17.jpg"><br>
When I was 13, my grandfather was there when I graduated 8th<br>
grade. Somehow, I did it the first time around.
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/18.jpg"><br>
When I was 14, my journeys with my grandfather still<br>
continued. We had been traveling for 10 years now. Note my<br>
displeasure at having to turn around to look at the shrub maze...
<br><br><br><img src="pictures/19.jpg"><br>
Now that I am 15, my grandfather is still there encouraging me<br>
whenever he can. As he sits and watches me, a percussionist in<br>
the Absegami Marching Band, I wonder if he remembers when I was<br>
four and I first showed him my musical talent at my birthday party.
<br><br><img src="pictures/title.jpg">
<br><br>I hope there are many more years to enjoy with my <b>ideal grandfather</b>.
